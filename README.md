# CharGen
My exploration of procedural and OOP oriented "generic" character generation.

By "generic" I don't mean simple, but rather universal. It's my ambition to make a system that can generate very comprehensive characters for no game system or fictional universe in particular.

I intent to use this project to explore my ideas on procedural generation, and I expect the project to change directions multiple times as I gain more experience and gets new ideas.
